This describes how to run the code to calculate covariances on a set of UC Davis flats.  It is run on 50 pairs of flats at 5 different intensities, so 500 flats total.  Since calcualting the covariances takes a long time, I split the code up into two pieces.  The Flat_Correlations... code calculates the covariances and writes the results to a set of files, and the Plot Correlations... reads these files and plots the results.

If you want to run these flat correlations, you need to do the following:

(1) The 500 flats are loaded into the SLAC database at the following web link:

http://srs.slac.stanford.edu/Decorator/exp/LSST-DESC/Decorate/UCD-sim/CCD/002/flats/20170808_002_flats/

or directly at the following SLAC path:

/nfs/farm/g/desc/u1/data/UCD-sims/CCD/002/flats/20170808_002_flats


(2) You will need to edit the Flat_Correlations_Diff_08Aug17.py code so that it can find these files.  Then you need to run it 5 times, once on each of the intensities, as follows:

python Flat_Correlations_Diff_08Aug17.py 20180808_002_flats 100
python Flat_Correlations_Diff_08Aug17.py 20180808_002_flats 200
...

It will take an hour or two to calculate the covariances, and will write a set of files like:

newmaskcorr_100_20170808_002_flats.txt

(3) After these are done, run the plotting code:

python Plot_Correlations_Varying_Flux_Errors_08Aug17.py 1 20170808_002_flats <outputdirectory>


This will generate the plots and write a file with the measured covarinces, which should look like the files in the directory VBB60_002_08Aug17


To apply this to measured spots at different intensities, the spot fits files are atthe web link:

http://srs.slac.stanford.edu/Decorator/exp/LSST-DESC/Decorate/UCD-sim/CCD/002/brighter-fatter/20170809_002-bf-30um/

or:

/nfs/farm/g/desc/u1/data/UCD-sims/CCD/002/brighter-fatter/20170809_002-bf-30um

These are not exactly the same spots files that I used, but I am running against these to see the results. If they don't look good, I'll load up the spots files that I used.

As always, comments would be appreciated.
